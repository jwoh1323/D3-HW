            <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>

            <p>Wealth is even more unequally distributed than income in the United States and may be more important for intergenerational health disparities. 
              While the top 10 percent of earners receive about half of all income in the United States, they hold more than three-quarters of all the wealth. 
              The net worth of white Americans is more than fifteen times that of black Americans and thirteen times that of Hispanic Americans. During 
              the recession of 2007–10, overall family net worth decreased by 8 percent and declined in all groups except the wealthiest 10 percent, whose 
              net worth increased. Wealth supports educational attainment; housing stability, particularly through homeownership; and financial security, 
              particularly during older age—all of which affect health outcomes. One recent study found that middle-aged Americans in the highest quintile of 
              wealth had a 5 percent chance of dying and a 15 percent chance of becoming disabled over the next decade, while those in the lowest wealth quintile had 
              a 17 percent chance of dying and a 48 percent chance of becoming disabled.</p>
            
            <p>Many factors besides inequality affect health, of course. How much people smoke, whether they are obese, and the safety of air and water, among many 
              other factors, make a difference. But the effect of inequality was statistically significant, equivalent to a difference of about 11 days of life between 
              high- and low-inequality places. The differences were small, but for every increment that a community became more unequal, the proportion of residents dying 
              before the age of 75 went up.</p>
